# LSTM Cell Implementation using VHDL

This is a Vivado 18.01 compatible project repository, and it does not use any board specific IPs, to ensure maximum compatibilities.
The project right now is synthesizable, but due to the direct interfacing, number of I/O ports used exceeds the available ports by a large margin, and cannot be implemented.
The source codes are available in `project_4.srcs`.
